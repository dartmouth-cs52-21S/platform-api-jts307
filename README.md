# Shiitake Posts Server API

This is the api of the Shiitake Posts platform. The api is pretty standard, I just followed the directions in the lab assignment.

## What Worked Well

- Finding and calling the mongoose commands, they seemed pretty straight forward. 

- Getting this hooked up to my blog frontend.

## What Didn't

- I would have liked to spend some time on extra credit, but unfortunately I did not have enough time.

- Nothing didn't work well. Everything in the assignment seems to work well. Hopefully, I didn't miss a bug or anything. 

## Extra Credit

- none :(
